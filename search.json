Trying to think of informative/meaningful names for objects is hard, but necessary work! Below are the fundamental rules for naming objects in R:\n\nnames can’t start with a number\nnames are case-sensitive\nsome common letters are used internally by R and should be avoided as variable names (c, q, t, C, D, F, T, I)\nThere are reserved words that R won’t let you use for variable names (for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next)\nR will let you use the name of a predefined function—but don’t do it!\n\nYou can always check to see if you the name you want to use is already taken via exists():\nFor example lm exists\n\nexists(\"lm\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nbut carleton_college doesn’t.\n\nexists(\"carleton_college\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThere are also a lot of naming styles out there, and if you have coded in another language, you may have already developed a preference. Below is an illustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI generally following the tidyverse style guide, so you’ll see that I use only lowercase letters, numbers, and _ (snake case).",

    "section": "Extracting pieces of data frames",
    "text": "Extracting pieces of data frames\nSince data frames are the fundamental data structure for most analyses in R, it’s important to know how to work with them. You already know how to get an overview of a data frame, but that isn’t always very informative. Often, you want to extract pieces of a data frame, such as a specific column or row.\nExtracting rows\nData frames can be indexed by their row/column numbers. To extract elements of a data frame, the basic syntax is data_set[row.index, column.index]. So, to extract the 10th row of office_ratings we run\n\noffice_ratings[10, ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  season episode title    imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      2       4 The Fire         8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n\n\nNotice that to extract an entire row, we leave the column index position blank.\nWe can also extract multiple rows by creating a vector of row indices. For example, we can extract the first 5 rows via\n\noffice_ratings[1:5, ]\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  season episode title         imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                 7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      1       2 Diversity Day         8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n3      1       3 Health Care           7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n4      1       4 The Alliance          8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n5      1       5 Basketball            8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n\n\nHere, 1:5 create a sequence of integers from 1 to 5.\nWe could also specify arbitrary row index values by combing the values into a vector. For example, we could extract the 1st, 13th, 64th, and 128th rows via\n\noffice_ratings[c(1, 13, 64, 128), ]\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 6\n  season episode title            imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                    7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      2       7 The Client               8.6        2631 2005-11-08\n3      4      13 Job Fair                 7.9        1977 2008-05-08\n4      7      11 Classy Christmas         8.9        2138 2010-12-09\n\n\nExtracting columns\nSimilar to extracting rows, we can use a numeric index to extract the columns of a data frame. For example, to extract the 3rd column, we can run\n\noffice_ratings[,3]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nAlternatively, we can pass in the column name in quotes instead of the column number\n\noffice_ratings[,\"title\"]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nNotice that the extracted column is still formatted as a data frame (or tibble). If you want to extract the contents of the column and just have a vector of titles, you have a few options.\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column number:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[3]]\n\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column name in quotes:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[\"title\"]]\n\n\nYou could use the $ extractor with the column name (not in quotes):\n\n\noffice_ratings$title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract the 35th row of office_ratings.\nExtract rows 35, 36, 37, and 38 of office_ratings.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column index number.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column name.",

    "text": "Lists\nIt turns out that data frames are special cases of lists, a more general data structure. In a data frame, each column is an element of the data list and each column must be of the same length. In general, lists can be comprised of elements of vastly different lengths and data types.\nAs an example, let’s construct a list of the faculty in the MAST department and what is being taught this winter.\n\nstat_faculty &lt;- c(\"Kelling\", \"Loy\", \"Luby\", \"Poppick\", \"St. Clair\", \"Wadsworth\")\nstat_courses &lt;- c(120, 220, 230, 250, 285, 330)\nmath_faculty &lt;- c(\"Brooke\", \"Davis\", \"Egge\", \"Gomez-Gonzales\", \"Haunsperger\", \"Johnson\", \n                  \"Meyer\", \"Montee\", \"Shrestha\",\"Terry\", \"Thompson\", \"Turnage-Butterbaugh\")\nmath_courses &lt;- c(101, 106, 111, 120, 210, 211, 232, 236, 240, 241, 251, 321, 333, 395)\n\nmast &lt;- list(stat_faculty = stat_faculty, stat_courses = stat_courses, \n             math_faculty = math_faculty, math_courses = math_courses)\n\nOverview of a list\nYou can get an overview of a list a few ways:\n\n\nglimpse(list_name) and str(list_name) list the elements of the list and the first few entries of each element.\n\n\nglimpse(mast)\n\nList of 4\n $ stat_faculty: chr [1:6] \"Kelling\" \"Loy\" \"Luby\" \"Poppick\" ...\n $ stat_courses: num [1:6] 120 220 230 250 285 330\n $ math_faculty: chr [1:12] \"Brooke\" \"Davis\" \"Egge\" \"Gomez-Gonzales\" ...\n $ math_courses: num [1:14] 101 106 111 120 210 211 232 236 240 241 ...\n\n\n\n\nlength(list_name) will tell you how many elements are in the list\n\n\nlength(mast)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nExtracting elements of a list\nSince data frames are lists, you’ve already seen how to extract elements of a list. For example, to extract the stat_faculty you could run\n\nmast[[1]]\n\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n\nor\n\nmast[[\"stat_faculty\"]]\n\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you had only used a single bracket above, the returned object would still be a list, which is typically not what we would want.\n\nmast[1]\n\n$stat_faculty\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone Check point\n\n\n\nExtract the statistics courses offered this term.",

    "title": "R Basics",
    "section": "Vectors",
    "text": "Vectors\nThe columns of the office_ratings data frame and the elements of the mast list were comprised of (atomic) vectors. Unlike lists, all elements within a vector share the same type. For example, all names in the stat_faculty vector were character strings and all ratings in the imdb_rating column were numeric. We’ll deal with a variety of types of vectors in this course, including:\n\nnumeric\ncharacter (text)\nlogical (TRUE/FALSE)\n\nExtracting elements of a vector\nJust like with lists (and therefore data frames), we use brackets to extract elements from a vector. As an example, let’s work with the title column from office_ratings.\n\ntitle &lt;- office_ratings$title # vector of titles\n\nTo extract the 111th title, we run\n\ntitle[111]\n\n[1] \"New Leads\"\n\n\nor two extract the 100th through 111th titles, we run\n\ntitle[100:111]\n\n [1] \"Double Date\"          \"Murder\"               \"Shareholder Meeting\" \n [4] \"Scott's Tots\"         \"Secret Santa\"         \"The Banker\"          \n [7] \"Sabre\"                \"Manager and Salesman\" \"The Delivery: Part 1\"\n[10] \"The Delivery: Part 2\" \"St. Patrick's Day\"    \"New Leads\"           \n\n\nNegative indices\nSometimes, we want to “kick out” elements of our vector. To do this, we can use a negative index value. For example,\n\ntitle[-1]\n\nreturns all but the first title—that is, it kicks out the first title. To kick out multiple elements, we need to negate a vector of indices. For example, below we kick out the first 10 titles\n\ntitle[-c(1:10)]\n\nAnd now we kick out the 5th, 50th, and 150th titles\n\ntitle[-c(5, 50, 150)]\n\nThis idea can be adapted to lists and data frames. For example, to kick out the first row of office_ratings, we run\n\noffice_ratings[-1,]\n\n# A tibble: 187 × 6\n   season episode title             imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n 1      1       2 Diversity Day             8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n 2      1       3 Health Care               7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n 3      1       4 The Alliance              8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n 4      1       5 Basketball                8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n 5      1       6 Hot Girl                  7.8        2852 2005-04-26\n 6      2       1 The Dundies               8.7        3213 2005-09-20\n 7      2       2 Sexual Harassment         8.2        2736 2005-09-27\n 8      2       3 Office Olympics           8.4        2742 2005-10-04\n 9      2       4 The Fire                  8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n10      2       5 Halloween                 8.2        2561 2005-10-18\n# ℹ 177 more rows\n\n\nor to kick out the math courses from the mast list we run\n\nmast[-4]\n\n$stat_faculty\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n$stat_courses\n[1] 120 220 230 250 285 330\n\n$math_faculty\n [1] \"Brooke\"              \"Davis\"               \"Egge\"               \n [4] \"Gomez-Gonzales\"      \"Haunsperger\"         \"Johnson\"            \n [7] \"Meyer\"               \"Montee\"              \"Shrestha\"           \n[10] \"Terry\"               \"Thompson\"            \"Turnage-Butterbaugh\"\n\n\nLogical indices\nIt’s great to be able to extract (or omit) elements using indices, but sometimes we don’t know what index value we should use. For example, if you wanted to extract all of the 300-level statistics courses from the stat_courses vector, you would need to manually determine that positions 2:5 meet that requirement. That’s a lot of work! A better alternative is to allow R to find the elements meeting that requirement using logical operators. Below is a table summarizing common logical operators in R.\n\n\nComparison\nMeaning\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nis equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n\nIn order to extract the 300-level statistics courses, we’ll take two steps:\n\nWe’ll determine whether each course is numbered at least 300,\nthen we’ll use that sequence of TRUEs/FALSEs to extract the course.\n\nSo, first we use the logical operator &gt;= to compare stat_courses and 300. This returns TRUE if the element meets the specification and FALSE otherwise.\n\nstat_courses &gt;= 300\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nNow, we can use this vector as our index. Only the TRUE elements will be extracted:\n\nstat_courses[stat_courses &gt;= 300]\n\n[1] 330\n\n\nThe same idea can be used with data frames and lists, just remember how to format the brackets and indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract all statistics courses below 250 from stat_courses.\nExtract all math courses except for 240 (probability) from math_courses.\nExtract all rows from season 3 of The Office.",

I recommend using the tinytex installation that is included with quarto. To install it, click on “Terminal” within RStudio and type the following:\nquarto install tinytex\nAfter doing all of the following, you can check that it is working correctly by:\n\nOpen rstudio\nClick “File –&gt; New File –&gt; Quarto document” and choose the “PDF” output option\nMake a small change to the file within the editor and click “render”. If all goes well, you should end up with a PDF document!\n\nFor Stat340 coursework, it will be helpful to have some additional R packages installed.

This course serves as a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian statistical inference and modeling, an alternative to the frequentist approach to statistics covered in previous classes. Topics include: Bayes’ Theorem; prior and posterior distributions; Bayesian regression; hierarchical models; and model adequacy and posterior predictive checks. Computational techniques will also be covered, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and modern Bayesian modeling packages in R."

Students who are not prepared for a compact schedule, or who are looking for an easier workload, may find it challenging. A solid foundation in statistics and a strong level of commitment are essential to keep up with the material and succeed in the class.\nAsk questions in class, Amanda has no problem reviewing a previously discussed concept.\nWork with other people in the class, collaboration is key\nStart the homework early!

This could not be further from the truth! The best statisticians don’t necessarily have the “best” math or programming background, but are people that are able to formulate interesting questions and use math and programming to rigorously answer those questions. Many of the best statisticians I know became statisticians because they were initially interested in something else (biology, public health, psychology, neuroscience, physics, etc.) and realized that being able to answer important questions with data was not only valuable but fun and interesting. Being able to perform interesting statistical analyses is a skill that is learned, not an innate ability, and working hard at developing that skill is the point of this course."

How do you interpret this probability?\n\nIf we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 90% of the time.\nCandidate A is much more likely to win than to lose.\nThe pollster’s calculation is wrong. Candidate A will either win or lose, thus their probability of winning can only be 0 or 1."
