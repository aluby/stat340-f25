|   | Collaboration Allowed |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Homework Problems | You are allowed and encouraged to collaborate on homework. You may also use outside resources, but your submitted work must be your own and reflect your own understanding . |
| Lab Quiz Problems | **No collaboration is allowed at all** . You may use your own notes for resubmissions, but should not use outside resources. |
| Portfolio Projects | You are expected to collaborate with your group, but cannot rely on external sources other than to help motivate the questions or provide other background information. Getting answers on significant parts of solutions from outside resources is not allowed. |
| Final Project | You are expected to collaborate with your group, but cannot rely on external sources other than to help motivate the questions or provide other background information. Any outside resources should be properly cited. |

## Use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) {.smaller}

-   Treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT or Gemini, the same as other online resources.

-   Guiding principles:

    -   \(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. AI should facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.

    -   \(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

-   **❌ AI tools for writing code:** You may not use generative AI to take a "first pass" at a coding task. Do not type coursework prompts directly into AI tools.

-   **✅ AI tools for debugging code:** You may make use of the technology to get help with error messages or trying to fix issues

-   **❌ AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.
