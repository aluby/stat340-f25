# BR Exercise 2.16

If the link from the textbook doesn't work, try this link from the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250117223825/https://www.thedailybeast.com/are-over-half-the-works-on-the-art-market-really-fakes/)

# BR Exercise 2.21

# BR Exercise 3.8

# `summarize_beta_binomial`

Write your own R function that does the same thing as `summarize_beta_binomial`. It's OK if your output is formatted differently and you do not need to write formal checks. 

::: callout-note
If you need a refresher on writing functions in R, I recommend:

+ [R4DS Ch25](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html) for an overview of functions in R with practice problems
+ [My Stat220 slides](https://stat220-s25.github.io/slides/16/slides16.html#/title-slide) for a quick refresher
