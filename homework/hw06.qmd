# BR Exercise 9.9

Throughout this chapter, we explored how bike ridership fluctuates with temperature. But what about humidity? In the next exercises, you will explore the Normal regression model of rides ($Y$) by humidity ($X$) using the `bikes` dataset. Based on past bikeshare analyses, suppose we have the following prior understanding of this relationship:
  - On an average humidity day, there are typically around 5000 riders, though this average could be somewhere between 1000 and 9000.
  - Ridership tends to decrease as humidity increases. Specifically, for every one percentage point increase in humidity level, ridership tends to decrease by 10 rides, though this average decrease could be anywhere between 0 and 20.
  - Ridership is only weakly related to humidity. At any given humidity, ridership will tend to vary with a large standard deviation of 2000 rides.

(a) Tune the Normal regression model (Eq. 9.6) to match our prior understanding. Use careful notation to write out the complete Bayesian structure of this model.
(b) To explore our combined prior understanding of the model parameters, simulate the Normal regression **prior** model with 5 chains run for 8000 iterations each. HINT: You can use the same `stan_glm()` syntax that you would use to simulate the posterior, but include `prior_PD = TRUE`.
(c) Plot 100 prior plausible model lines ($\beta_0 + \beta_1 X$) and 4 datasets simulated under the priors.
(d) Describe our overall **prior** understanding of the relationship between ridership and humidity.

# BR Exercise 9.10

With the priors in place, let’s examine the data.
(a) Plot and discuss the observed relationship between ridership and humidity in the bikes data.
(b) Does simple Normal regression seem to be a reasonable approach to modeling this relationship? Explain.

# BR Exercise 9.11

We can now simulate our posterior model of the relationship between ridership and humidity, a balance between our prior understanding and the data.
(a) Use `stan_glm()` to simulate the Normal regression posterior model. Do so with 5 chains run for 8000 iterations each. *HINT:* You can either do this from scratch or `update()` your prior simulation from Exercise 9.9 using `prior_PD = FALSE`.
(b) Perform and discuss some MCMC diagnostics to determine whether or not we can "trust" these simulation results.
(c) Plot 100 posterior model lines for the relationship between ridership and humidity. Compare and contrast these to the prior model lines from Exercise 9.9.
