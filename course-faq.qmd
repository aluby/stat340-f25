## Where can I get help? 


### Office hours and appointments

The best place to come for help is Amanda's office hours! I can help with anything related to the course. You can also check [my calendar](https://calendar.app.google/t7pRBCmp8SxCzPCE7) for one-on-one appointment slots. 

### Stats Lab

Students needing help with their Statistics coursework and R/Rstudio questions can get help from Stats Lab Assistants in the Stats Lab in CMC 304. Stats Lab Assistants are primiarily for Stat 120 (Intro Stats), but they may also be able to assist  with general R/Rstudio questions.
