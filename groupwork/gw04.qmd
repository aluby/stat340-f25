# BR Exercise 7.76

# BR Exercise 7.7: Calculate the acceptance probability

Suppose that a Markov chain is currently at $\lambda^{(i)}=2$ and the proposal for $\lambda^{(i+1)}$ is $\lambda' = 2.1$. For each pair of unnnormalized pdf $f(\lambda) L(\lambda | y)$ and proposal $q(\lambda' | \lambda)$, calculate the acceptance probability $\alpha$ used in Step 2 of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 

(a) 
(e) For which of these scenarios is there a 100% acceptance probability? Explain why weâ€™d certainly want to accept $\lambda$ in these scenarios
